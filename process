Purpose of the Simulation:
The MATLAB code simulates how a PLC controls a nonlinear industrial process using a PID controller to achieve a desired setpoint automatically.

Sampling and Time Setup:
The process is simulated for 10 seconds with a sampling time of 0.01 seconds, meaning control actions are updated every 0.01 s.

Nonlinear Process Modeling:
The process output changes based on the equation
y(i) = y(i-1) + T*(-k1*y(i-1) + k2*u(i)^2)
showing that the system is nonlinear because of the square term (u²).

Setpoint Definition:
The setpoint is fixed at 5, meaning the system should maintain the output (like temperature, level, etc.) around 5 units.

Controller Role:
The PID controller continuously calculates the error = (setpoint - actual output) and adjusts the actuator signal to minimize it.

Control Parameters:

Kp = 2: Controls proportional response.

Ki = 1: Reduces steady-state error.

Kd = 0.5: Controls overshoot and improves stability.

Integration and Derivative Terms:
Integral accumulates the total error over time, while derivative predicts future error trends for smoother control.

Actuator Output (u):
The actuator output is limited between 0 and 10 volts, representing real PLC output constraints.

Process Response (y):
The output gradually increases and stabilizes near the setpoint, showing the control system’s ability to reach steady state.

Sensor Response Plot (5.1.1):
This graph shows blue curve = process output, red dashed line = setpoint.
You can explain how the output starts low, rises smoothly, and then settles close to the setpoint.

Setpoint vs Process Output (5.1.2):
This plot shows the relationship between the desired value and achieved value — ideally, they align closely, proving controller accuracy.

Actuator Response Plot (5.1.3):
The actuator initially produces a strong control signal (green curve) to overcome error and then reduces once steady state is reached.

Closed-Loop Feedback Plot (5.1.4):
Combines process output, setpoint, and actuator output in one graph — useful to show how feedback stabilizes the system.

Feedback Mechanism Explanation:
Whenever output deviates from the setpoint, the controller automatically adjusts the actuator output to bring it back.

System Stability:
The smooth approach of the output towards the setpoint indicates a stable closed-loop control system without oscillations.

Response Time (5.1.5):
The calculated response time shows how quickly the system reaches 95% of its final value — displayed in MATLAB command window.

Steady-State Error:
MATLAB prints the difference between final output and setpoint, which should be very small, showing effective control.

Error Plot (5.1.5 continued):
The error vs time graph shows the difference reducing to near zero — a sign of accurate and efficient control action.

Practical Relevance:
This simulation mirrors how a PLC controls real nonlinear processes like pressure regulation, tank level control, or temperature control.

Final Observation:
The simulation validates that the designed PID-controlled PLC system can effectively handle nonlinearities and maintain desired performance.
